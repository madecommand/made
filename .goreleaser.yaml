    description: |-
      made is a command line tool that automates the execution of commands defined in Madefiles and Makefiles, searching for these files in various directories, concatenating their sections, and producing a shell script for execution. It extends the functionality of make by reading not only the Makefile/Madefile in the current directory but also Madefiles in different locations within the system.
